# Selenium Automation Test Practice

This project contains Selenium automation scripts I wrote to test key user flows on a demo e-commerce website. The main goal was to showcase my skills in writing automated tests using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and TestNG.

## What I Tested ✔️

* **Login** 🔐 — making sure users can sign in smoothly
* **Logout** 🚪 — checking users can log out without issues
* **Registration** 📝 — creating new accounts
* **Cart** 🛒 — adding products and verifying they’re in the cart

## Demo Website 🌐

All tests run on [Advantage Online Shopping](https://advantageonlineshopping.com), a demo site perfect for practicing automation stuff.

## Tech Stack 💻
